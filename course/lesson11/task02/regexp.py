Regexp
------
Write an application that performs a set of operations on a given file defined
in a ``05-regexp`` task.  A file shall be specified as the first argument.  All
operations shall be executed in the same order as they appear in a command line.
For example, ``-a -o -a`` means that a command defined for option ``-a`` shall
be performed, followed by a command for option ``-o`` and a command for ``-a``
once again.
