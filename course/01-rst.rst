Course
======

reStructuredText markup language
--------------------------------
A **reStructuredText** is a flexible simple yet powerful markup language used as
a documentation standard in many companies and organizations (e.g. Cisco,
Google, IETF, PSF, etc).  There are many tools allowing to generate different
documents from **reST** format (e.g. HTML, PDF, Latex, etc).  Some tools enhance
or restrict specific **reST** features for their needs.

Acknowledge with **reST** markup language basics at an `official page
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__.

Python doc-strings
------------------
A simplified form of **reStructuredText** is used for **python doc-strings**.
There are a lot of tools to generate an exhaustive documentation out of
doc-strings.  A `PSF Documentation <http://python.org/doc/>`__ was generated
this way.

Read `PEP 257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`__ about **python
doc-string** conventions.

`PEP 257` is not enough strict, hence, there are many corporate conventions
built on top of it.  I recommend to stick to `Google doc-string conventions
<http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`__.

docutils package
----------------
A **docutils** is a python package to generate documentation out of **reST**
format and, in particular, off **python doc-strings**.  There are other popular
tools to do this task, like `epidoc`, `Sphinx` etc.

Install **docutils** using `sudo pip install docutils` command.

sphinx project
--------------
A **Sphinx** is a new mainstream documentation standard for Python.  It
elaborates an **reST** format from **docutils** and extends it with a rich set
of directives.

Personally, I don't like its documentation syntax and am not very familiar with
it, but very likely that on your next project it will be required to use
**Sphinx**, hence, it is mandatory for a Python developer to know about it.

Tasks
=====

Truth Table
-----------
Create an **reST** document containing truth tables for a set of boolean
expressions.  It should be possible to convert this document to both HTML and
PDF without parser errors.  A result should have a proper structure with a
heading, table of contents, sections, well-formatted tables.

The following boolean expressions should be considered:

    - a and b or c
    - (a and b) or c
    - a and (b or c)
    - a or not (b or a) or (not c and b)
    - (a or not b) and (c or not a)
